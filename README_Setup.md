## ðŸ”§ Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
â€¢ Node.js (v14+)

â€¢ Python (v3.8+) with pip

â€¢ MongoDB
### Quick Start
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jia2005/GH-25_IPA.git
   cd GH-25_IPA
   npm install
   npm install sweetalert2 pdfjs-dist
   ```

2. Set up Python environment
   ```bash
   cd api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ..
   ```

3. Create .env file with:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id 
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
   **Note**: The .env file isn't included in this repo. You'll need to create your own and get a Google Client ID. You also need to add this Google Client ID in your /pages/Login.js

4. Start the servers
   ```bash
   npm start
   
   # In another terminal (git bash ONLY)
   cd api
   . venv/Scripts/activate
   flask run
   ```
